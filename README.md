# Inventory Optimization Python
Python-based Inventory Optimization Model (Demand forecasting, EOQ, Safety Stock, ROP, Monte Carlo Simulation).

A simple, self-contained Python project for supply chain analytics.  
It simulates demand, forecasts usage, calculates EOQ, Safety Stock, Reorder Point, and runs a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate service level.

## Features
- Simulated daily demand for multiple SKUs  
- Demand forecasting using:
  - Moving Average
  - Simple Exponential Smoothing  
- Inventory policy calculations:
  - Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)
  - Safety Stock (SS)
  - Reorder Point (ROP)
- Monte Carlo simulation of inventory position and stockouts
- Visualizations using Matplotlib

## Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
